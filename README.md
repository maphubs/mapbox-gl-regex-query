# Mapbox Regex Query

Query source data using a regex filter

This is an unofficial plugin, and is not affliated with Mapbox. ðŸ˜‡

ðŸš§This is not using the public API and will likely break between versionsðŸš§

* Version 0.1.2 = tested with mapbox-gl-js v0.37.0
* Version 0.2.0 = tested with mapbox-gl-js v0.43.0


This is my temporary workaround until regex is supported directly in mapbox-gl-js, I recommend helping with that directly if you can, see: https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/4089 

## Installation

```sh
npm install mapbox-gl-regex-query
``` 


or to use directly in the browser download `dist/mapbox-gl-regex-query.js` from this repo

## Usage

```js
var RegexQuery = require('mapbox-gl-regex-search');
```
or in the browser
```html
<script src="mapbox-gl-regex-query.js"></script>
```

The use by by calling `querySourceFeatures`

```js
RegexQuery.querySourceFeatures(sourceID, filter, map);
```

Use `~=` to active the regex filter. It also works in `any` and `all`  filters.

Example: 

```js

var map = new mapboxgl.Map({
  /* ... */
});

var onSearchButtonClick = function(){
    var results = RegexQuery.querySourceFeatures('diners-drive-ins-and-dives',
    {
      sourceLayer: 'locations',
      filter: ['all',
        ['==', 'state', 'VA'],
        ['~=', 'name', '/.*burgers.*/g']
      ]
    },
    map);
}

```
